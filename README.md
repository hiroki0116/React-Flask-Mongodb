### Full-stack React-Flask web application

- React
- Flask
- Mongodb Atlas

Simple web application to try CRUD implementation. 
React will fetch data and present for the front-end. It also allows user to send POST request and store data in mongodb Atlas via API.

Flask is connected to mongo Atlas and provides API.
As I deployed the backend system on AWS, you do not need to launch local server for the backend.


### USE

This application is still on the course of development. No validation either responsive design yet.It will eventually help people who are planning to go traveling my hometown Sapporo, Japan by introducing terrific restaurants or fun activities.

*Admin page is now accessible by anyone. Thus, I will make this repo private soon.
